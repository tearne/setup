# AGENTS Guidelines

- Read definitions and terminology in `DEFNS.md`
- Read specifications (`SPEC.md`), both in the root, and potentially nested within subfolders

- When planning nontrivial changes update the `TODO.md` which sits alongside the relevant `SPEC.md`
- Keep the TODOs up to date
- Pause between TODO items and invite the operator to review
