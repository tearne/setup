## Python Orchestrated Script (POS)
The POS style is intended for when Python code take the place of native shell scripts. It strategically breaks some Python idioms to combine the different strengths of Python and shell scripts.

POS guidance:
- POS favours subprocess calls for shell commands, while using Python control flow.
- If there is a reasonably simple command to achieve a task in the shell, prefer running that command in a subprocess over the equivalent Pythonic code.
- This makes it easier for users to discover the command they may want to copy and paste into a terminal.
    - Examples:
        - To download the latest version of the `helix` `deb` for `amd64`:
        ```py
        subprocess.run(r"""curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/helix-editor/helix/releases/latest | grep -oP '"browser_download_url": "\K[^"]*amd64.deb' | xargs wget""")
        ```
        - To apt install `curl`:
        ```py
        subprocess.run("""DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -y curl""")
        ```
    - But don't take this to an extreme and force trivial actions like loops into to the shell.
- Prefer a single Python source file, unless it compromises readability.
- Make the python file executable and use a `uv` shebang
```sh
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script
# /// script
# requires-python = "==3.12.*"
# ///
```
- Rather than complex configuration, set the script up with key functions at the top of the file, so they can be easily commented out or used to jump to navigate.
- Keep utility functions towards the bottom of the file.
- Guard against being run directly (e.g. `python3 script.py`) instead of via `uv run`. Check for `VIRTUAL_ENV` or `:wUV_INTERNAL__PARENT_INTERPRETER` in the environment and exit with a helpful message if neither is set.
- Try to keep to built-in Python libraries to maximise future compatibility.
- Use:
    - `argparse`
    - `pathlib`
